# This table allows three kinds of mappings:
# 1: From major class to comma separated lemmas (place -> place,location)
# 2: From subclass to comma separated lemmas (city -> place,location,burg,metropolis...)
# 3: From markable string to comma separated markable strings (United States -> USA,US,America...)
# Suffix a ,* to an entry to show that it may ignore morphological agreement matching for subclass search
